# ðŸš€Credit card Fraud Detection Model using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Task Objectives:
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts fraudulent transactions using a dataset of financial transactions. 

The project includes:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding
- Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- Model Evaluation and Accuracy Comparison
